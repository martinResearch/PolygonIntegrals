@article{Manson2013,
abstract = {We present a method of analytically rasterizing shapes that have curved boundaries and linear color gradients using piecewise polynomial prefilters. By transforming the convolution of filters with the image from an integral over area into a boundary integral, we find closed-form expressions for rasterizing shapes. We show that a poly- nomial expression can be used to rasterize any combination of polynomial curves and filters. Our rasterizer also handles rational quadratic boundaries, which allows us to evaluate circles and ellipses.We apply our technique to rasterizing vector graphics and show that our derivation gives an efficient implementation as a scanline rasterizer},

@article{Auzinger2013,
abstract = {In this paper we present a parallel method for high-quality edge anti-aliasing. In contrast to traditional graphics hardware methods, which rely on massive oversampling to combat aliasing issues in the rasterization process, we evaluate a closed-form solution of the associated prefilter convolution. This enables the use of a wide range of filter functions with arbitrary kernel sizes, as well as general shading methods such as texture mapping or complex illumination models. Due to the use of analytic solutions, our results are exact in the mathematical sense and provide objective ground-truth for other anti-aliasing methods and enable the rigorous comparison of different models and filters. An efficient implementation on general purpose graphics hardware is discussed and several comparisons to existing techniques and of various filter functions are given.},
